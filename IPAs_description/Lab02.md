# Lab 02 - Integers and IO Operations

Lab02 deals with integers, floats, IO operations (mainly  `printf` and  `scanf`), conditionals (if-statements), and simple loops (for and while-loops).

## Ex01 - Maximum between 3 Numbers

Write a program that determines and prints the largest of three integers given by the user.

## Ex02 - Order 2 Numbers

Write a program that reads two integers `N, M` and prints the smallest of them in the first line and the largest in the second.

## Ex03 - Divisor

Write a program that reads two positive integers `N, M` and prints "yes" if `M` is a divisor of `N`, otherwise print "no".

## Ex04 - Order 3 Numbers

Write a program that reads three integers and prints them in order on the same line. The smallest number must appear first.

## Ex05 - Cycle

Write a program that reads a positive integer `N` and prints the numbers `1..N`, one per line.

## Ex06 - Major and Minor

Write a program that determines the largest and smallest number of `N` real numbers given by the user. Consider that `N` is a value requested from the user.

The result must be printed with the command `printf("min: %f, max: %f\n", min, max)`.

*Hint:* initialize the largest and smallest to the first read value.

## Ex07 - Divisors

Write a program that asks the user for a positive integer `N` and prints the number of divisors of `N`. Remember that prime numbers have 2 divisors.

## Ex08 - Average

Write a program that calculates and prints the average of `N` real numbers given by user. The program should first ask the user for an integer `N`, representing the number of numbers to be entered. The real numbers must be represented by float type. The result must be printed with the command `printf("%.2f", avg);`.

## Ex09 - Time Conversion

Write a program that asks the user for a value `N` corresponding to a certain period of time in seconds. The program should output this period of time in the format `HH:MM:SS`.

*Hint:* use the operator that calculates the remainder of the division (`%`).

## Ex10 - Digits

Write a program that asks the user for a positive value `N`. In the output, it should show the number of digits that make up `N` (on the first line), as well as the sum of the digits of `N` (on the second line).

For example, the number 12345 has 5 digits and the sum of these digits is 15.
